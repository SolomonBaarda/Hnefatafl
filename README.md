### What is Hnefatafl?
see [Wikapedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games)

Hnefatafl is a traditional nordic board game, sometimes described as "Viking Chess".  It is part of the "Tafl" family of board games which commonly feature two teams of uneven numbers - attackers and defenders.  The goal is for the attacking team's King to escape to one of the four corners of the board while the defender has to prevent this happening and try to trap the King on all four sides.

**This is my first real project using the Unity engine and C#** and so I am just getting familiar with it.  I followed a [chess tutorial by N3KEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzImJk7ZesI&t=755s) on Youtube to learn the basics of Unity and crate a simple board game.  I am now working on this game entirely by myself.
