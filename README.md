# Hnefatafl

Hnefatafl is a traditional nordic board game, played with two players.  There are two teams: atttackers and defenders.  The goal is for the attacking team to move their king to one of the four corners of the board while the defender has to prevent this happening and trap the king on the board.  

This is my first real project using the Unity engine and C# and so I am just getting familiar with it.  I am following a chess tutorial by "N3KEN" on Youtube for the basis of my game and will be adding onto it once complete.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzImJk7ZesI&t=755s
